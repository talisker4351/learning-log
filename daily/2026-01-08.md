### Today
I studied how decision trees are used in Kaggle Learn.

### Insight
A decision tree is a method that organizes a sequence of Yes/No questions.
In my business, it can be used for decision-making related to product shortages and order quantity planning.

For example:
- Is the current inventory less than a 7-day supply? (Yes / No)
- Does it take a long time to restock? (Yes / No)

These decision rules are automatically generated from past sales and inventory data.

### Next
I will continue studying decision trees on Kaggle Learn.
