### Today
I learned how to explore housing price data using Pandas DataFrames and the `describe()` function in Kaggle Learn.

### Insight
The `describe()` function shows the mean, standard deviation, and percentiles, which helps me understand the distribution of the data.
We also discussed missing values, and since missing data appears in my work as well, it felt very relevant.

### Next
I will continue learning about machine learning.
