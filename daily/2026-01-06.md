### Today
I studied how to use specific symbols in prompts to improve the quality of responses from generative AI.

Previously, I relied mostly on trial and error, but structured learning clearly leads to better and more consistent results.

### Next
Starting tomorrow, I will intentionally incorporate symbols even into my simplest prompts.
