**Today**
Today, I created a tool to improve the quality of generative AI responses by generating Tableau calculated fields using specific prompt symbols that I learned yesterday.
**Insight**
I investigated why generative AI can produce highly accurate HTML. There are three main reasons:
1. There is an overwhelming amount of HTML training data worldwide.
2. HTML is a predictable language for AI to generate.
3. HTML is structurally close to natural human language.
**Next**  
I will continue using it and refine the tool based on actual use.
