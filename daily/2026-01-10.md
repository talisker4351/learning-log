### 2025-01-10 Kaggle Learn – Feature Selection & Modeling

**Today**  
I selected the target and the features from a large dataset and built a decision tree model to predict prices.

**Insight**  
By paring down many variables to the most important ones, the model becomes easier to understand and more accurate.

**Connection**  
I can apply this approach to sales and inventory data to choose key factors and make better ordering decisions, though selecting the right variables is still challenging.

**Next**  
I will continue learning about machine learning.
